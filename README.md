# Top 100 Social Media Platforms

Repository for Ethan Zuckerman and Chand Rajendra-Nicolucci, "Top 100: The most popular social media platforms and what they can teach us." The essay can be found here.

The dataset provided here is an attempt at listing the 100 most popular social media platforms in the world. The list was gathered using a combination of SimilarWeb’s [list](https://www.similarweb.com/top-websites/category/computers-electronics-and-technology/social-networks-and-online-communities/) of the top 100 social networks and online communities, Alexa’s [list](https://www.alexa.com/topsites) of the top 500 sites on the web, and Wikipedia’s [list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_social_networking_services) of social networking services. The collection was done in November 2020. For further information on the methodology used to construct the list see the essay mentioned above.

* top_100.csv: contains 100 rows, where each row consists of a social media platform, its logic, its popularity score, and its country. The rows are sorted in order from most to least popular. (Explanations for the columns can be found in the associated essay.)
